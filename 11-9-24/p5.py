# Problem 5: Sports and Players
# Create a function named list_sports() that returns the following list of sports: "Football", "Cricket", "Tennis", "Basketball".

# Create a function named famous_player(sport) which receives a string argument representing a sport and returns the name of a famous player in that sport. For example, "Football" should return "Lionel Messi".

# Call list_sports() and use famous_player() to print statements about each sport and a famous player, like "Lionel Messi is a famous FootballÂ player."

def list_sports():
    return ["Football", "Cricket", "Tennis", "Basketball"]

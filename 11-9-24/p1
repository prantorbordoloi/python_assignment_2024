# Problem 1: Fruits and Statements
# Create a function named list_fruits() that returns the following list of fruits: "Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango".

# Create a function named build_fruit_statement(fruit) which receives a string argument representing a fruit and returns a sentence that starts with the given fruit and ends with " is a delicious fruit."
# Call list_fruits() and use build_fruit_statement() to print statements for each fruit.


def list_fruits():
    return ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]

def build_fruit_statement(fruit):
    return (f"{fruit} is a delicious fruit ....")

fruit = list_fruits()
for i in fruit:
    print(build_fruit_statement(i))

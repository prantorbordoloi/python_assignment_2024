Problem 1: Create a list of students, where each student is represented by a dictionary
containing the student's ID, name, and grade. Write a function to add a new student to the list.
Extend the function to check if a student with the same ID already exists and prevent duplicates.



Problem 2: Create a dictionary to represent the inventory of a store, where the keys are item
names and the values are tuples representing the price and available quantity. Write a function to
update the quantity of an item after a sale. Modify the function to display an error message if the
item does not exist in the inventory.
